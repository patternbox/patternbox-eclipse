PatternBox is a design pattern editor for Eclipse. It creates Java classes and interfaces that can 
be customized depending on your application needs. Most approaches to that issue are wizard-dominated. 
This means you have to complete the whole design pattern instance at once. Using PatternBox you have 
freedom and flexibility to insert new pattern members whenever you want.
